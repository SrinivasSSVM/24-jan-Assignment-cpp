2. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a pointer to an object of a certain class and then converts it to a pointer to an object of a different class using the const_cast operator. The program should then display the original pointer and the converted pointer to the user.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class A {};
class B {};

int main()
{
    A* a = new A();
    cout << "Original pointer: " << a << endl;

    const A* b = const_cast<const A*>(a);
    cout << "Converted pointer: " << b << endl;

    return 0;
}
